# Digital-Sustainability-Study
RÃ©visions pour les examens, TP sur Git et GitHub

#I add a sentence on a file downloaded locally, (and trying to commit and push it afterward to GitHub)
#By upploading it via GitHUB (with the same name, idk if it changes something or not) and then create a Pull request that shows the changement from the uploaded file that was changed. Only then we can pull the commit to the main branch and apply the changes (the upper line was added to the README file)
